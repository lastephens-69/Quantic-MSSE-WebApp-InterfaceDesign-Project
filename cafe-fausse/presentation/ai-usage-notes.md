# AI Tooling Summary (Paste into submission)

I used ChatGPT (Quinn) to:
- Parse the SRS and rubric; extract required pages and functional elements.
- Scaffold a full‑stack project (React + Flask + PostgreSQL) including file structure, routing, and API endpoints.
- Generate React forms with client‑side validation and responsive layout using Flexbox and Grid.
- Create backend models, schema, and availability logic preventing overbooking across 30 tables per timeslot.
- Draft the README with run instructions and demo tips.
- Suggest deployment approaches and environment variable conventions.

What worked well:
- Rapid scaffolding of boilerplate, consistent naming, and enforcing SRS requirements.
- Iterative improvements to UX copy and validation details.

What I implemented/modified by hand:
- Local environment setup and DB provisioning.
- Content tweaks (styling, imagery, copy) and any integration with real deployment targets.
- Testing data and presentation flow for my recorded demo.
